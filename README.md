# RootlessJB6

rootlessJB5 is the latest release of 
rootlessJB, this time supporting iOS 15.0 to 15.4.1. With the release of iOS 15, Apple made some significant changes to the root filesystem and how it reacts to unauthorized changes. Due to these measures, any unauthorized modifications of the root filesystem will cause a kernel panic, causing your device to immediately reboot. Until a solution or workaound has been discovered to circumvent these security measures, iOS 15 users will have to use a rootlessJB, which doesn't directly modify the root filesystem.
